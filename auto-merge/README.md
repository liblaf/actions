# Auto Merge

This GitHub Action automatically merges pending pull requests (PRs) generated by [Release Please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please). It filters PRs by a specified GitHub App author and label, then adds a custom label to the identified PR before merging. The action is configurable with inputs for the repository, GitHub token, labels, and app author.

## Usage

To use this action in your GitHub workflow, add the following step to your workflow file (e.g., `.github/workflows/auto-merge.yaml`):

```yaml
name: Auto Merge Release Please

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 0 * * 0" # Run weekly

jobs:
  auto-merge:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Auto Merge Release Please
